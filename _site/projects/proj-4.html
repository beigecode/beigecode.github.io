<p class="proj-description">
   http://floatapp.com/ - Float is a cashflow forecasting app that integrates with accounting platforms like Xero, Quickbooks and FreeAgent.
    I was a part of team of 4 developers where I get to improve the UX, UI  and deliver new features by working with BackboneJS, Coffeescript and Rails on the backend.
