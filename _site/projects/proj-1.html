    LastCloud app is a web experiment that I've created using the APIs of my favourite music discovery websites : Last.fm and SoundCloud.
    It is a single-page webapp built with AngularJS on the front-end that allows user to query their friend's or favorite artist's username, displaying the tracks that they've liked or produced.
    Soundcloud tracks are also playable within the app and Last.fm tracks provide artist's biography and list of artists similar to this genre.
