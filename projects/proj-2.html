<p class="proj-description">
  AMAT (Assessment Module Authoring Tool) is a single-page web app built for creating interactive tests that are later used to test students in the proprietary assessment platform that we developed for a client at Intrallect <em>(see the next project for details)</em>.
  AMAT is built using AngularJS framework on the front-end and SQL Server with Spring Framework on the back-end.
